// For someone who is new to the media library business, an "asset" is the term we use
// to describe something we can sell. We want to move into video but, right now, most
// of our highest performing assets are photographs. We make the most money off of
// high-resolution photos taken by freelance photjournalists and inserted into news
// feeds around the world.
//
// An asset could be anything - we've even experimented with some interactive Flash content.
// So that's the way we built this data store.
//
// However, for now, you can treat "asset" and "large picture file" as interchangeable terms.

/**
 * Describes a sellable piece of content; e.g., a picture or a video file.

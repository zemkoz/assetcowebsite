// [jmj, 2017/jun/5]
// Again, we have what seems like a pretty serious bug. I've pinged everyone I can think of and nobody's getting back to me.
// In this file, it's possible for an asset to take up multiple spots in the high-value hotspot group. Depending on how the
// UI interprets that information, it could results in an asset consuming multiple high-value pieces of screen real estate.
// It seems pretty obvious that the intent was for hotspots to be a set - and I have no idea why they aren't; maybe order matters? -
// but what if the UI is using a hotspot group as an actual list of assets to work from for something like high-value assets?
// 
// If they're doing that, then, like I said, an asset showing up twice in the list would be a serious problem. If they're just
// going off the main search results, like they should be, and using the hotspot groups to test for whether or not an asset
// should get special treatment, this isn't an issue.
//
// Again, everyone is so busy with whatever they're working on that I cannot get a clear answer from anyone...
// Does this really happen, ultimately? Nobody will tell me. It's a difficult case to find in production, or I'd check myself.
//
// Is it really a problem if it is happening? Absolute radio-silence from product & marketing on this matter.
//
// Given that I don't know if this is a problem or if it should be fixed here, I'm not going to take the risk of fixing it.
// I'll just kick the rock down the road and let it be the next person's problem. If that person's you, sorry. This is where you would fix
// the problem...
